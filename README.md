# fcc-git-nomic
A [Nomic](http://nomic.net) game designed to teach new developers git and Github workflows for open source contributions.

# What is this?

Broadly speaking, this is a game in which the primary 'move' is to propose rules for the game which other players will vote on.

The rules can be found here: [RULES.md](https://github.com/JacksonBates/fcc-git-nomic/blob/master/RULES.md)

The purpose is to familiarise developers with Github Pull Requests (PRs), and as such rules will be proposed and discussed via PRs.

Since this is also an (albeit unofficial) freeCodeCamp project, it will abide by the freeCodeCamp [Code of Conduct](https://freecodecamp.org/code-of-conduct).

These two founding principles (PRs and the CoC) will serve as Universal Constants, like the speed of light, and as such they cannot be changed by new rules or amended by players.

All other rules are subject to the amendment or revocation by whatever means are legally valid under the existing ruleset of the game!

Have Fun! 

# Getting Started

Simply put, to contribute you must fork this repo, make your changes on a new branch of your repo, and then create a Pull Request with this repo. The initial rules state that you cannot propose a new rule if there are pending rules you have not voted on. However, given the nature of the game, this rule may have changed by the time you read this...read the rules carefully.

Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JacksonBates/fcc-git-nomic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details about how to fork, branch and create Pull Requests if you are unsure of how to do this.
