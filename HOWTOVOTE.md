# How to vote

I order to create your pull request, first you'll have to vote to open Pull Requests as stated in rule 4 - Citizenship Rights. So, go to Pull requests.

Open Pull request you want to vote for, and read the comments. It is important to read the comments since the author of pull request can update initial request based on discussion. If there were some changes you will be able to see them between comments, like shown in picture below.

When you make up your mind it is time to vote. It is nice to state your opinion clearly and to leave reasoning behind it. Example:

*I vote against this proposal.*

*Reasoning: You can give your explanation here.*


In addition to casting your vote by leaving a comment, you should also "react" to the first comment in pull request. Your reaction should be thumbs up or thumbs down.

After you casted votes for all open pull requests, you can go ahead and create your first pull request. Good luck, and have fun while learning at the same time.
